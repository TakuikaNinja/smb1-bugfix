This file is based on the changes originally done by Ribiveer.
Changes marked with '+' are new additions/contributions that were not part of Ribiveer's original set of changes.

## Music Changes
- [ ] There is now music on the title screen: an alternate version of the underwater theme.
- [x] The final victory song has been extended, with a B-section and an ending. (ported over from Vs.SMB; may need to adjust further)
+ [x] Level music now uses a smoother volume envelope from Vs.SMB (most noticable in castles). Other envelopes are left unchanged.

## Sound Changes
+ [x] Skidding now has a sound effect, in line with SMB2J and later entries.
+ [x] Springboards now make the block bump sound effect when bounced on, in line with SMM/SMM2.
+ [x] The unused notes at the beginning of the power-up sound have been restored, as originally intended.
+ [x] The 1-up sound now has top priority in its queue, fixing a bug where one sound can be initialized and play for a single frame, but continued as a corrupted 1-up sound.
+ [x] 1-up mushrooms no longer play the power-up sound for a single frame before the 1-up sound plays. (unrelated to the aforementioned bug).

## Bug Fixes & Small Tweaks
+ [x] Scroll unlock object in underground warp zone now works as intended. (no more minus world)
+ [x] An erroneous increment of the warp zone value has been removed. (1-2 warpzone pipe destination stays at 1-2 exit until warp zone loads)
+ [x] The positions of warp zone triggers have been adjusted so that they are now loaded before the player can enter the pipes early. (1-2, 4-2)
+ [x] Warp zone triggers and flagpoles will no longer set the scroll lock. Extra scroll lock objects have been added to compensate for this. (also prevents running past the flagpole)
+ [x] Scroll lock objects now explicitly set the scroll lock instead of toggling it.
- [x] Lakitus now throw their spinies as originally intended.
+ [x] The initial number of lives is now set to 5 like in later entries, to compensate for the difficulty change.
+ [x] Warm start detection & continue functions now check ContinueWorld for a valid value. (no more glitch worlds)
- [x] Falling while crouching now keeps your sprite crouched. Additionally, the down input now nullifies left/right inputs while crouching on the ground.
- [x] While underwater, crouching no longer messes up the hitbox.
- [x] Small Mario's walking animation now flows better.
- [x] Stars are now guaranteed to jump out of their blocks, as opposed to sometimes falling down.
+ [x] The lives system now uses the zero flag instead of the negative flag for game over detection. (no more 128 lives glitch, even if you could reach it)
- [x] The lives counter now displays the number of lives above 9 like normal, until the 10's digit exceeds 9 in which it will be displayed as ðŸ‘‘ (crown).
- [x] Lives are now capped at ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘ (two crowns) to prevent overflows.
- [ ] The lives screen now properly reflects Mario's power-up state.
- [x] Player status is now correctly set to falling while collecting a power-up. (no more item jump)
- [x] Getting the flagpole stops the star invincibility, to prevent audio glitches.
- [x] Holding the run button while Fire Mario no longer makes him fire a fireball while entering an area.
- [x] Holding the jump button no longer makes Mario jump while entering an area.
+ [x] Getting hit on the same frame as touching the axe will no longer damage Mario. (no more Small Fire Mario, sorry)
+ [x] Running out of time as Fire Mario will now properly change the palette before killing Mario.
+ [x] FireballThrowingTimer & PlayerAnimTimer will now stay in sync. (no more skating/sliding glitch)
- [x] Enemies & kicked shells now keep their momentum while going off a ledge. Some enemy placements were adjusted to compensate for this but oddities may still be visible.
+ [x] The offscreen bounds check will now check if the enemy is active first, to prevent enemies from being erased twice.
+ [x] The enemy's high Y coordinate is now checked instead of relying on addition overflow in SubtEnemyYPos. (e.g. enemies will no longer hover when stomped in pits)
+ [x] BlockBufferCollision will now correctly clamp the Y tile coordinate to prevent reading garbage data. (SubtEnemyYPos seems to have been an attempt to work around it)
+ [x] After falling into a pit, the gameplay will now halt in the same manner as being killed by an enemy. (prevents dying twice to hammers)
- [x] The fortress in 5-1 has been changed to a castle, for consistency.
+ [x] The bridge railing no longer overshoots the first gap in 2-3/7-3.
+ [x] 2-3/7-3 now have the water backdrop for better continuity from the previous level.
+ [x] Coin Heavens (cloud levels accessed via vines) now have the cloud backdrop.
+ [x] Vine autoclimbing is now enabled when the player is touching it in the upper half of the screen, instead of the HUD area. (prevents wraparound glitch)
+ [x] The underwater section of 8-4 now uses the grey colour scheme for better continuity within the level.
- [x] Fire Mario and Fire Luigi now have separate palettes. (Luigi uses the palettes from SMM2)
- [x] Green Cheep Cheeps now appear green underwater. (they are still called grey internally)
- [x] When entering a horizontal warp-pipe, Small Mario will now always stand still and Big Mario will now always crouch.
+ [x] When entering a vertical warp-pipe, Mario will now always stand still like in later entries.
- [x] Both players can now always pause the game. Some other input checks will also check for both players when appropriate.
+ [x] The locations of some warp destination change and loop command triggers have been tweaked. (no more wrong warps; notably 4-2, 8-4)
+ [x] Hidden coin/1up blocks no longer mess with the tile directly to its right. (notably 2-1, 5-1)
+ [x] The scroll handler has been overhauled and is now more robust. (e.g. getting stuck in a wall updates the scroll properly)
+ [x] Firebar blocks will no longer cause head injuries as big Mario.
+ [x] Firebar collision detection now checks the relative player position instead of querying the OAM buffer. (yes, really)
+ [x] Instances of recalculating the player's relative position have been replaced with variable reads instead. (fixes vine wraparound glitch)
+ [x] Tweaked parameters of the PAL optimized Cheep Cheep code to better replicate the behavior of the NTSC version. (jump-height and gravity)
+ [x] Tweaked brick-shattering behavior to consistently bump the player downwards when hitting an enemy from below or shattering from the corner with high momentum.
+ [x] Grabbing the flagpole while inside the base block will no longer skip the flag slide animation.
+ [x] The Game Text system has been overhauled and now utilises a command byte ($fe) to denote the player name.
+ [x] The routine for displaying victory messages in castle levels has been overhauled and now uses the Game Text system.
+ [x] Ported a few miscellaneous tweaks, bug fixes, and optimizations from SMB2J, SMAS, and Vs.SMB.
+ [x] Tweaked controller reading code to mask out left+right/up+down inputs. Additionally, the polling loop now uses the ring counter technique.
+ [x] Moved the main game loop out of NMI and made the NMI handler more robust. (no more glitched scanlines, HUD flickering, or music slowdown)
+ [x] EnableNMI & WritePPUReg1 will no longer incur an extra NMI if they are called while the VBlank flag is set.
+ [x] The reset handler has been tweaked to better resemble the sample implementation on NESdev Wiki.
+ [x] Optimized, tweaked, and trimmed code wherever possible. (ongoing effort)

## Modernised Quality of Life Mechanics
- [x] Holding A now allows you to bounce on enemies higher, like in later entries.
- [x] Getting a Fire Flower as Small Mario now turns Mario into Fire Mario, as opposed to Super Mario.
- [x] Getting hit as Fire Mario now turns Mario into Super Mario, as opposed to Small Mario.
+ [x] Fireballs will now remain onscreen when Fire Mario has been hit. They will freeze during the hit animation, just like enemies do.
- [x] Hidden 1-up blocks no longer despawn after dying. The requirement to spawn them has been retained.
- [ ] Hitting the top of the flagpole now gives Mario a 1-up.
- [ ] The scoring system has been adjusted to that of later entries.
- [ ] Defeating consecutive enemies with a Super Star now gives you more points, eventually giving 1-ups!
- [ ] Defeating consecutive enemies now increases the sound effect pitch with every enemy.

## Enemy Behaviour Changes
- [x] Hammers now travel along their arc, regardless of whether they touch Mario.
- [x] Enemies like Goombas, Koopas, Buzzy Beetles and Spinies will only turn around when colliding with walls or other enemies.
- [x] It is now possible to defeat Spinies by hitting blocks underneath them.
+ [x] Paratroopas will now be set to the falling state instead of the grounded state when stomped. 
+ [x] Red Paratroopas will now be properly demoted to Red Koopas when stomped.
+ [x] Bullet Bills fired from cannons are now able to collide with enemies, including kicked shells. (notably 7-1, now you can farm lives there)
+ [x] Jumping Green Paratroopas now move faster in Quest 2 and demote to the appropriate speed in Quest 2.
+ [x] Swimming Cheep Cheeps now move up and down farther after 5-3.
+ [x] Lakitus respawn more quickly after 5-3. Additionally, they will now always spawn at the correct height with the correct hitbox.
+ [x] Platforms moving downwards will now properly drop the player into pits.
+ [x] Balance Platforms now have more checks in place to prevent collision oddities (notably 4-3).
+ [x] Balance Platforms will no longer move if the left platform has been unloaded, or has been replaced by another enemy. (prevents the 6-3 "Bullet on a string" glitch)
+ [x] Landing on Moving Platforms will now clear the stomp chain counter.
+ [x] Enemies will now clear more of their variables when unloading, in order to minimize oddities. (e.g. Collecting a star when it has negative Y speed no longer causes mushrooms to jump)

## PAL Version Changes
- [x] Cheep Cheep code has been optimised.
- [x] Pipes at the end of underwater levels now don't have an empty block above them.
